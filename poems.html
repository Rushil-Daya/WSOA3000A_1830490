                Sunflowers are life. <br/>
                They are yellow.  <br/>
                Yellow is happiness.  <br/>
                You are my happiness. <br/>
                You are my life.  <br/>

                She was there when you drew on the wall </br>
                She was there when you came home 1 min late </br>
                She was there when you forgot the tupperware at school </br>
                And there when you came home drunk</br>
            </p>
            <p>
                She watched you change your Capri-sun </br>
                For 1818</br>
                And your 49 to a 90</br>
            </p>
            <p>
                Champal. The mother of the house. </br>
                Your past, your future.</br>
                She'll be there when you graduate</br>
                She'll be there when you get married</br>
                And be sure as hell</br>
                She'll be there when you forget your anniversary.</br>
