        <p>
            It's short   <br/>
            It's fleeting   <br/>
            But it can be everything you want it to  <br/>

        </p>

        <p>
            It's called the present for a reason <br/>
            It's a gift  <br/>
        </p>

        <p>
            If someone is on your mind...they're probably there for a reason <br/>
        </p>
        <p>
            Eveything i just said is a clichè <br/>
            It's clichè for a reason <br/>
