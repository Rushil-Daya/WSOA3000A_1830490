        <section class="poemContent">
            We're here right now
            You're sad because of your past
            and anxious over your future.
            These together are stopping you from being happy right now

            Our lives are in the present
            Learn from  your past and 
            let go of what it was
            Have faith in what it will be 
            And enjoy what it is.

            Lets stop asking questions for a little
            and together arm in arm
            look at the stars 
            sip our tea
            and savor how lovely being in this moment can be.
