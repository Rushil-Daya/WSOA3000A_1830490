        <h2>This Moment</h2>
<pre>
We're here right now
You're sad because of your past
and anxious over your future.
These together are stopping you from being happy right now

Our lives are in the present
Learn from  your past and 
let go of what it was
Have faith in what it will be 
And enjoy what it is.

Lets stop asking questions for a little
and together arm in arm
look at the stars 
sip our tea
and savor how lovely being in this moment can be.
