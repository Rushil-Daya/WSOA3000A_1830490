            She was there when you drew on the wall </br>
            She was there when you came home 1 min late </br>
            She was there when you forgot the tupperware at school </br>
            And there when you came home drunk</br>
        </p>
        <p>
            She watched you change your Capri-sun </br>
            For 1818</br>
            And your 49 to a 90</br>
        </p>
        <p>
            Champal. The mother of the house. </br>
            Your past, your future.</br>
            She'll be there when you graduate</br>
            She'll be there when you get married</br>
            And be sure as hell</br>
            She'll be there when you forget your anniversary.</br>
