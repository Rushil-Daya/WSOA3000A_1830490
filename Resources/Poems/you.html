    <h2>You</h2>
<article>
<pre>
Why is it the way that you complain makes me smile
The way you argue makes me laugh
And the way you smile makes me speechless

Why can't we have small talk
Why can't we have awkward silences

I want to argue with you everyday
And listen to Kutch Kutch Hota hai 
Drinking chai 
Next to you with
A cheese samoosa
