        <h2>True</h2>

    
        <section class="poemContent">
            Focus on you
            Until the focus is on you

            That's life.
            True love isn't something you can chase
            It's something that comes to you
            When you're your True self

            Because what value is a love 
            That forms when you aren't 
            Yourself.
