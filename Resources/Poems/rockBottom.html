    <h2>Rock Bottom</h2>

<pre>
They say you only appreciate something
When you no longer have that very thing

Why did it take <a href="broken.html">losing everything</a>  about me
To appreciate who I am

What is it about reaching rock bottom
That all you can do is 
Go up

But like everything 
It's a state of mind
You can continue falling
Loosing yourself
But one day you need to decide
That
that exact <a href="thisMoment.html">moment</a> is your 
Rock bottom.
