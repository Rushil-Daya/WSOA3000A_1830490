    <h1>Website style guide</h1>

    <h2>UI design</h2>
    <p>
        The UI design is aimed to create a casual yet professional feel. The layout of the poems and gallery achieves this via a grid system. The grid
        allows content to feel more collected. In line with sound UI and UX practices, the site features:
        <ul>
            <li>Meaningful hyperlinks (not Click 'here' but rather links on appropriate keywords)</li>
            <li>Meaningful input structues (for example a slider for range based input). The respective input structures were chosen to allow user to
                immediately grasp the nature of input such as: textboxes for text, radio buttons and checkboxes for choices and sliders for numeric inputs.
            </li>
            <li>Incorporation of icons when hovering over links to indicate the link direction (For example return links show a reverse arrow)</li>
            <li>Extensive use of meaningful display structures. (For example lists for grouped content and grids for graphic content)</li>
            <li>Visual feedback (For example when you hover over an image in the gallery a link appears to go to the respective poem)</li>
        </ul>
        
    </p>
    <h2>Colour scheme</h2>
    <p>
        The colour pallette for the website is aimed to create a professional atmosphere. The use of a biege background (#F6FFF8) is aimed to create 
        a subdued and book-like feeling. The red (#B23850) is used for the headings.
    </p>
   

    
    <h2>CSS structures</h2>
    <p>
        For the Gallery and Poetry pages the CSS grid structure was used. This was chosen as the grid structure will allow the page to be responsive (it will auto adjust
        its coloums and rows based on the current pages scaling). Furthermore, the grid structure allows for a more controlled layout.
