        She was there when you drew on the wall 
        She was there when you came home 1 min late 
        She was there when you forgot the tupperware at school 
        And there when you came home drunk

        She watched you change your Capri-sun 
        For 1818
        And your 49 to a 90

        Champal. The mother of the house. 
        Your past, your future.
        She'll be there when you graduate
        She'll be there when you get married
        And be sure as hell
        She'll be there when you forget your anniversary.
