        <section class="poemContent">
            everyday the same story
            every time the same feelings
            the same emotions
            
            bad days
            great days
            productive days and some
            a complete waste of daylight
            
            
            we bump into eachother
            the usual smile paints our faces
            as it has the last few months
            every single time
            
            this time as we walked away
            something was different
            we were both lonely
            but didn't think much of it walking away
            
            something was different 
            I no longer felt alone
            and you neither
            something happened
            kutch kutch hota hai.
