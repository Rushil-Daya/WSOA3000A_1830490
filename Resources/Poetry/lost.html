            I was lost 
            Lost in the world surrounded by signs
            I looked and them
            But I didn't see them.
            I didn't want to

            My heart was lost
            <a href="lost.html">Lost</a> in a world surrounded by lovers
            I saw them
            But I <a href="broken.html">didn't</a> accept them

            My mind was busy
            Busy driving me towards a <a href="Your-reason.html">future</a> I'd appreciate
            I knew this
            I lived by this

            It was then, when I was <a href="Focus.html">focused</a> on my goals 
            That I found you.
            It was then,that I decided to
            <a href="roses.html">See</a> the signs
            Accept your love
            And it was then, that I realised
            I was no longer lost
            I had found <a href="trueLove.html">myself.</a>
