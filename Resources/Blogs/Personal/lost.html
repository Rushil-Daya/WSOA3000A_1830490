        <p>
            <a href="../../Poetry/lost.html">This</a> was also written in my post-changed era. Life was good, it still is.
        </p>
        <p>
            At this time I was thinking about what my life was like before, and understanding why I wasn't happy and why I kept
            attracting the wrong people into my life. One of the biggest realisations was that everything was there
            I just didn't consciously accept and pay attention to it. The signs were there, I just didn't want to look.
            Why didn't I want to look? I'm still thinking about this. Do you have any idea? <a href="../../Contact/index.html">Let me know.</a>
        </p>
        <p>
            These months as I've mentioned I've just being doing me and focusing on my goals. And yes, I've honestly been attracting 
            the right people into my life now. At the end, I realised that I had found myself (and that's when I wrote the poem).
