    <h1>Being 20 and Indian</h1>

    <p>
        I’m not sure you know this, but I’m 20 years old. For me that isn’t really old, I’ve 
        literally been around for 20 years which is barely a third of some of my aunts’ ages. But now 
        let me put you in my mom’s shoes (or basically any Indian/brown women’s’ shoes). When they were 
        20 years old, they were getting married and some of my aunts had their first child by now. Yea don’t 
        ask how they afforded such because the last time I asked, my mom threw her <a href="../Poems/champal.html">champal</a> at me.   
    </p>
    <p>
        So, as expected in brown households, my asked me when I’m getting married. What did I say? I told her wasn’t she supposed to 
        arrange me (just to see her reaction). Because we all know how it is in this culture. At times I won’t lie these aunties find really amazing ladies for their 
        sons. Its literally a whole event where the aunties get together and suggest their daughters to the guys mom and they literally stay 
        there and debate about their children. Back to the story, my mom was surprised she thought that I’d bring someone home (which I will). 
        Nonetheless, she said she’d call up her friends and start organizing. I haven’t felt so famous before, no lie. 
    </p>

    <p>
        I told my mom I’d help her and what better way to do it, than with technology. So, I’ve created an application and match finder form attached 
        to the website. I see you(if you're a lady lol). Why are you smiling? Is it because you know that I’ll make the best chai for you while you sit in bed every Sunday? Because you’re right… go 
        ahead and  <a href="../JavascriptFunctionality/ArrangedWeddingApplication/Application.html">apply.</a>
