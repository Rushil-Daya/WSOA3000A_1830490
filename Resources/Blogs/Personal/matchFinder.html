    <h1>Finding "The one"</h1>

    <article>
        <p>
            Dating in today's world is weird. Some are twenty year old and haven't had their first relationship, some are ten years old and have had their heart broken six times
            already. It's crazy, but I'm sure this happened in the 60's right? This pandemic has been making me think to be honest. 
        </p>
        <p>
            It all started when I realised that I would not be able to physically meet new girls for the next couple of months. That's a good
            thing right? I could rather spend the time finding myself, but then I remembered Instagram and Tinder. Our modern day brothels. 
            If you're active on these platforms, you'd know how busy your dms were since the beginning of quarantine. It makes sense right? People are bored at home
            and needed something to 'do'ðŸ‘€
        </p>
        <p>
            This got me thinking. Pre-Tinder and Instagram you would usually meet a couple of new people a week, now you have the potential to meet thousands
            a day. The game has completely changed. You can literally have as many people you want on your hook, it's crazy. These technologies (Tinder and Instagram)
            have further blurred the line between the physical and digital world and have essentially used the power of the digital world to accelerate
            our physical relationships. 
        </p>
        <p>
            I then thought about my wedding application <a href="../../JavascriptFunctionality/ArrangedWeddingApplication/Application.html">form</a> I created. As it is 
            presented on a website, it has the potential to reach millions. I'll be honest, there will be a couple of people who don't match with me or that want 
            to keep their options open (Let's be real, nobody talks to just one person anymore). I wanted to cater for them, and to do this I created my own Tinder.
            But it's more serious, we don't play games and swipe left anymore -we email. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Take a look. Fill in the <a href="../../JavascriptFunctionality/ArrangedWeddingApplication/Application.html">form </a> and have a look at your
            matches. It's 2020 we're in quaratine, we're bored, I got you.
