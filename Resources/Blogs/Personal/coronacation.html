    <h1>Coronacation</h1>

            Corona. Covid-19. I'll stop there before you rage exit my site. I wouldn't blame you. I don't need to add to the constant bombardment 
            we get. You do know what I'm talking about right, if you don't I'm concerned. Genuinely worried. I'm here for you. I can be more than 'here'
            for you if you'd like ;). Fill out this <a href="../../JavascriptFunctionality/ArrangedWeddingApplication/Application.html"> form</a> and we'll be in-touch ;)

            For me the worse aspect about this pandemic is the fact that it ruined my favourite beer. That and the constant pestering that comes at 4am everyday 
            when I'm alone with my thoughts. What is is about after 1am. Have you watched How I Met Your Mother? Ted's right, nothing good happens after 1am. 
            But those hours are special, intimate and raw. Have you ever been on a call with someone you like at 2am, if you have I know you're going
            to agreee with me that those calls are different. They're pure and intentional.

            Back to corona. It feels surreal to be honest. We're actually living in textbook worthy times, imagine. When you're seventy (hopefully we get there) and your grandchild
            comes to you with a history question based off a time you actually went through. For a generation that is built up on self-gratification and 
            the need for instant approval, this pandemic will do wonders.

            This pandemic will end right? I mean yes it has only been a few months and with the capabilities of modern medicine it is assumed a cure
            would be made/found eventually, right? Or is this literally our lives now, living and hoping we don't get the virus. And when we do hoping 
            it does not mean the end. Yea I'm going to sign off now, this is getting too sombre for a Friday night. If corona wasn't around I'd probably be
            out and halfway drunk by now.
