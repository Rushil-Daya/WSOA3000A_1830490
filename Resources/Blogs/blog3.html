        My reflection on McLuhan, M. <cite>The Medium is the Message </cite> 
    </h1>

    <article>
        <p>
            My first reaction  to  reading, <cite>The Medium is the Message</cite>[1] was realizing that the ideas put forward were something I have never thought about.
            Yes, I’ve been made aware about how media is used in society, for example in propaganda techniques in the earlier wars 
            or how students learn material differently (auditory learners etc). I haven't joined the dots and realized that sometimes 
            the nature of the medium is more important than the message. My initial reactions were unconvinced. Yes, the medium is 
            important but surely what is being conveyed is more meaningful?
             
        </p>

            At schools while receiving a formal education, surely the content is more important that the way it is delivered? This idea gave rise to another thought. In early formal education 
            stages children often excel and enjoy subjects in which they find ‘fun’. Usually what determines why learners find a subject 
            'fun' -is the teacher. This idea compliments McLuhan’s idea: the form of the message influences the way in which it is perceived. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Giving this more thought, children are not only victim to this, everyone is. For example: if you are a student in university and your professor 
            is teaching Advanced Calculus and she is disorganized and says incorrect statements often, the chances are 
            you will stop attending. And unconsciously you will approach that course with a diffrent mindset compared to other courses. Another example, you are 
            at the airport and you see on your ticket that your boarding time is in 30 mins, no problem. But 2 minutes later you see  on the electronic board that your 
            flight number is highlighted in red indicating that boarding begins in 28 minutes, chances are you will start rushing. Simply because a more formal means 
            was used to convey the message.
        </p>
        <p>
            In conclusion, in my opinion, it comes down to context. In commercial branding, the way in which the product is advertised is more important; 
            but in formal education the content is more important than the medium.
