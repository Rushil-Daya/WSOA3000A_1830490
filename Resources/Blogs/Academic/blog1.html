            In <cite>As we may think </cite>  by Vannevar Bush(1945)[1] the idea in which knowledge is produced in the human mind, as opposed to mechanical systems is explored.
            Humans form links between ideas by way of association and data is accessed via similar means. 
            In mechanical systems data is often stored and accessed by a more structed system (i.e. alphabetical or numeric systems).
            The idea of changing this strtuctured method, to one that suits more similar ways in which the human mind works, is explored. This transition will result in a more natural system in which 
            links are formed via association and this was achieved through hyperlinks. Hyperlinks allow users to access related content via different (not necessarily indexed) webpages. 
            This will result in a user being able to jump in between related content as opposed to consulting  a traditional index page.

            Bush further suggested the idea of a <em>memex </em>[2] which is essentially a library- an indexed repository of knowledge (both public and personal). 
            This is similar to the modern idea of a personal computer. More fittingly the <em>memex</em> and its ideas and characteristics more closely resemble the fundamentals 
            of <em>Wikipedia</em>[3]. Wikipedia allows users to add their own content to exiting information and this can be accessed by others (like the idea of the memex 
            where the user updates their content and another user can access it). Furthermore, Wikipedia allows elements of an article to reference other related topics. 
            The memex also alludes to multitasking in the sense that one content can be projected and left whilst another is called up. Associative indexing 
            is another key element of the memex. In the current ideas of the internet this is employed via hyperlinks and metadata.
