    With the access and ability to use the above resources comes with the idea of visibility. How accessible are you? Yes, we have access to resources
    that allow us to join virtual communities but how easily can we be found by others? How is our digital presence portrayed? It's one thing
    being able to use digital resources/capital to connect but it is another issue reagarding how others can connect with you. Are we visible enought?
    In the end the biggest question and concern is, do we actually have control over our own visibility in the digital world? Have a look at 
    my blog entitled <a href="Digital-Visibility.html">Do we have control over our own life?</a> for more insight.

    Are you concerned? For the people who do have access to digital capital, who controls their visibility?
