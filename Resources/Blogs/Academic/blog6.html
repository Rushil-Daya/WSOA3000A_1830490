        Hypertext: Navigation and structure
    </h1>

            The term <em> hypertext </em> was coined by Theodor Holm Nelson [1]. The term started as an expression to describe <em> hypermedia </em>
            -which is human-authored media that is interconnected in such a manner that it cannot be illustrated on paper [1]. However, in the literary 
            community the term has its' emphasis solely on the link attribute. A definition of modern relevance is by Marie-Laure Ryan stating that hypertext 
            is text in which the reader decides how it will be read and followed by clicking on certain areas (hyperlinks) that open new segments of information[2].

            As key characteristic of hypertext is that it allows an interaction with information via association. The human mind learns by association 
            (consult the blog <a href="blog1.html"> 10/02</a>  <cite>As we may think</cite> by Vannevar Bush ) and this characteristic allows humans to convert all this 
            readily accessible information into knowledge.  
        </p>

        <p>
            The navigation of hypertext systems is aided by the browser. The browser allows the inclusion of hyperlinks and seamless access to the respective pages. The 
            way the system is ordered is non-sequential and this is inline with itsâ€™ associative characteristic.

            The structure, from a formal perspective follows the structure of hyperlinks and its respective html tags. The use of the <em> a </em> and <em>href </em> tags 
            are used to include the hyperlink. Furthermore, the link is displayed in a different colour on the webpage (blue) to aid the reader and indicate that this item 
            is in fact a link.
