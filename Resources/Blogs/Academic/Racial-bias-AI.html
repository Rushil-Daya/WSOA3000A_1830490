    <h1>Racial bias in Artificial Intelligence</h1>
    <article>
        <p>
            Artificial intelligence (AI) is the future, it is wide-spread and it is being incorporated into every aspect of our lives.[1] This gives AI a potential
            for large scale power in our current and future world. With such power comes the need for these systems to be ethically and socially just. This is
            currently not the case. There is a presence of racial bias in current AI systems.

            AI systems are wide-spread and thus so are its racial bias. In large scale surveillance systems for example racial bias has the potential
            to unethically target people of specific races. In more unecessary cases these systems stereotype and discrminate. For example in the British 
            passport system a case occured in which a black female photograph was flagged as it indicated that her mouth was open, when in fact it was not.

            There is also another case dealing with the popular social media app, Tiktok. In <a href=""></a> tweet
