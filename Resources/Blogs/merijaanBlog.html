    <h1>Inspiration behind the poem <a href="../Poems/meriJaan.html"> Meri Jaan</a></h1>

    <p>
        <em>Some insight: Meri Jaan is a Hindi word that someone calls their love. You usually only call this significant other this word when you truly love them.</em>
    </p>
   <p>
    I want to tell you about the biggest cliché there is when it comes to relationships. Two words: Chemistry and Timing. 
    And what’s the next line in the cliché? Timing, it’s a problem. Often you meet someone and there’s chemistry, but there’s 
    something that stops you from being together. You’re in different stages of your lives and as much as you want to be together, 
    the timing of everything  won’t let you. 
   </p>

   <p>
    But life has its ways and just like karma it isn’t always bad. All these times when the timing was off makes you value those 
    people you meet and the timing is just right. It's a similar idea to how we tend to place more value of people and things once we don’t have them 
    anymore (though for another day and this is one that crosses my mind every day). So yea, once in while the timing works out. And 
    that’s what happened to me. What’s it like when this happens… as usual I wrote about it- <a href="../Poems/meriJaan.html"> Meri Jaan</a>. Is it the same feeling for you?
