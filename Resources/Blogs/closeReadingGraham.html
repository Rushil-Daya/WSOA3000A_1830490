    <h1>A close reading of Graham et al’s <cite>Toward a study of information geographies[1]</cite>.  </h1>
    <p>
        The writers of this paper, <cite> Towards a study of information geographies: (im)mutable augmentations and a mapping of the geographies 
        of information, </cite> [1] Mark Graham [2], Stefano De Sabbata [2] and Matthew A.Zook [3] put forth the central idea that information has always had geography. 
        They expand on this statement by stating that information exists about somewhere, evolves somewhere and originates from somewhere and these places 
        can be physical or material. What is the value to their notion? Why does it matter that information has a geography? After reading their 
        paper it becomes evident that the writers are interested in this notion as the manner in which people find and understand different parts 
        of the world is dependant on these geographies of information.  Complimenting this, they state that geographic augmentations do more than 
        just represent and reflect places they form part of the place itself. They also realise and prove the geographic information itself is made 
        of a collection of uneven geographies.
        
    </p>
    <p>
        To understand their notion and thoughts thereof, they explore various methods in which information geographies have their own geographic influence: 
        geographic representation, participation and access. They perform their research via broad surveys of key platforms that are involved in geographic information. 
    </p>
    <p>
        To understand how geographic augmentations, shape a place rather than solely representing it, they present the following example: if a restaurant is 
        omitted from a map it will cease to be a restaurant as nobody can find it. This shows that these augmentations affect how places are brought into 
        being. This brings about an interesting idea, why does it matter how places are brought into being? This notion they put froth almost creates the 
        idea that places need to be marketed and if an area/place is not represented by some form of information, they are not part of the place itself. 
        Sometimes the mere fact that the place exists is enough and the way people perceive and came to know of the place does not matter. For example, 
        in Today’s fast paced world, many people know that a place exists and do not give much thought as to how it came into existence. On the other side, 
        a place that it not known and not represented do they form part of the place itself? Their notion is that geographic augmentations form part of the 
        place itself, what happens when a particular area is not represented? Does it not form part of the place itself?
    </p>
    <p>
        Becoming aware of this notion raises many thoughts. Geographical augmentations from part of the place itself and shape it rather than solely reflecting 
        it. How can one use this information to their advantage? Thinking about this, justifies many current occurrences in today’s world. E.g.  places like Paris 
        and London are popular around the world and have an associated status. Regardless of whether one has been to these places most often they would refer to 
        these places as ‘world class’ or somewhere they would love to go. Other places such as Pakistan do not receive such welcoming. People immediately associate 
        it with violence and unsafe, whereas once you complete some research you will realise that this is not the case. The way in which Pakistan is represented 
        is different to how France is. The biggest concern with this is that the people in the places itself are not always the only people responsible for creating 
        that respective place’s geographical augmentation.  As expected, this results in unfair and inaccurate representations and thus interpretations of many places.

        In the end, the question left is, is there anything we can do?
