        Welcome to my site. Open your mind because here you will find my past ,see my present and become a part of my future.

               My biggest self-taught lesson is: You have to step back from time to time and observe yourself through a third persons view; because sometimes you 
               are just too close to see it.

               <p> Sharukh Daya is an American born South African student. Currently studying at the University of the Witwatersrand a degree he does not enjoy.<br/>
                Due to this he is not fully invested and finds himself needing to express himself via art; he writes poems and takes freelance photography.
               Currently in his final year (3rd) and original plans to pursue an electrical engineering degree are rogue. Now his focus is shifted to continue his studies
                in another field overseas, preferably in his birthplace New Jersey. The poetry he writes has no common theme or genre; his muse ranges from an interesting 
                quote on Instagram to a random idea in his head when he’s in lectures.

                Physically, he’s skinny lean and above average height. Timid and reserved in nature and often does not stand up for himself as a result of his 
                upbringings.He is confident and over the recent year learnt the value of this the difficult way – heartbreak. Realizing his worth his life has
                 changed; he has a new outlook and people (especially ladies) come to him everywhere he goes. Maybe it is true- guys always change after their first heartbreak 
                 and never go back. Right now, in his current state of maturity and happiness, he feels it’s the perfect time to go to a new place and start over.

                He is characterized by being open minded and “chilled “by his peers. He doesn’t take much to heart and isn’t easily overwhelmed. Sometimes he 
                comes across as being naïve and ignorant due to this;  but in reality, he is just unbothered. He is unbothered by many things mainly because he 
                knows everything is temporary and this wouldn’t matter in a year so why stress about it. Don’t read it wrong, he isn’t unmotivated and goalless- he 
                just hasn’t found his motivation yet and that’s no issue as he’s focused on appreciating life in this moment. At campus you’d find him socializing 
                and getting high; but somehow, he pulls through in exams, mainly because he doesn’t want to spend any more time than necessary at Wits. 
                He loves the atmosphere at Wits, but now in the 3rd year it has become all to comfortable and he knows everyone- its time for something new.

            In <em>As we may think </em> by Vannevar Bush(1945) the idea method in which knowledge is produced in the human mind as opposed to mechanical systems is explored.
            Humans form links between ideas by way of association and data is accessed via similar means. 
            In mechanical systems data is often stored and accessed by a more structed system (i.e. alphabetical or numeric systems).
            The idea of changing this method to one that suits more similar ways in which the human mind works is explored which will result in a more natural system. 
            This was achieved through hyperlinks. These allow users to access related content via different (not necessarily indexed) webpages. 
            This will result in a user being able to jump in between related content as opposed to consulting  a traditional index page.
        </p1>
        <p2>

            Bush further suggested the idea of a <em>memex </em> which is essentially a library- an indexed repository of knowledge (both public and personal). 
            This is like the modern idea of a personal computer. More fittingly the ‘memex’ and its ideas and characteristics more closely resemble the fundamentals 
            of ‘Wikipedia’. ‘Wikipedia ’allows users to add their own content to exiting information and this can be accessed by others (like the idea of the memex 
            where the user updates their content and another user can access it). Furthermore, Wikipedia allows elements of an article to reference other related topics. 
            The memex also alludes to multitasking in the sense that one content can be projected and left whilst another is called up. Associative indexing 
            is another key element of the memex. In the current ideas of the internet this is employed via hyperlinks and metadata.
