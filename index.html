         My biggest self-taught lesson is: You have to step back from time to time and observe yourself through a <strong>third persons view</strong>; because sometimes you 
        are just too close to see it.

            Sharukh Daya is an American born South African student. Currently studying at the University of the Witwatersrand a degree he does not enjoy.
            Due to this he is not fully invested and finds himself needing to express himself via art; he writes poems and takes freelance photography.
            Currently in his final year (3rd) and original plans to pursue an electrical engineering degree are rogue. Now his focus is shifted to continue his studies
            in another field overseas, preferably in his birthplace New Jersey. The poetry he writes has no common theme or genre; his muse ranges from an interesting 
            quote on Instagram to a random idea in his head when he’s in lectures.

            He is characterized by being open minded and "chilled" by his peers. He doesn’t take much to heart and isn’t easily overwhelmed. Sometimes he 
            comes across as being naive and ignorant due to this;  but in reality, he is just unbothered. He is unbothered by many things mainly because he 
            knows everything is temporary and this wouldn’t matter in a year so why stress about it. Don’t read it wrong, he isn’t unmotivated and goalless- he 
            just hasn’t found his motivation yet and that’s no issue as he’s focused on appreciating life in this moment. At campus you’d find him socializing 
            and getting high; but somehow, he pulls through in exams, mainly because he doesn’t want to spend any more time than necessary at Wits. 
            He loves the atmosphere at Wits, but now in the 3rd year it has become all to comfortable and he knows everyone- its time for something new.
